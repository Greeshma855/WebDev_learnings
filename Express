To create a Express project,
Firstly npm init to initialize the project
-> npm init : Dependency Management , Version Control, Configuration
with npm init package.json and package-lock.json are created
-> package.json : describes projects and it's dependencies, contains all the metadata
-> package-lock.json : created by npm, has dependencies and their sub-dependencies.
If you look into package.json you will find dependencies and dev dependencies
-> dependencies : Required for application to run in production
-> dev dependencies : has libraries and packages required only during development
** If interested learn about testing, linting and bundling
Also there are scripts which is used for task automation Eg: start,test,build,lint....
